Before I get to the "in progress" I need to set the stage a bit.
I'm interested in conceptual control of complex models.
Traditionally NEURON has been used for models where cable properties
and complex membrane properties are important.

Argonne National Laboratory
Mira   Blue Gene/Q
786,432 cores  1 GB/core  
Networks simulations exhibit linear speedup with 2 processes per core.
This is the "easy" architecture to use effectively.

TACC
Stampede  Intel
6400 nodes  2 intel 8 core + xeon phi 61 core
If data is arranged properly each phi core can do 7 identical calculation
in the time it normally takes to do 1.

NCSA Illinos
Blue Waters  Cray
4200 NVIDIA Kepler GPU 2048 cores/gpu
Groups of 32 cores execute same code on different data.


Interleave order
Keep identical trees together, in order of increasing size
Work on groups of 32 cells. Last group may have fewer.
From a root to leaf treeorder, pick the next node of each cell.

Optimize parent node ordering
Keep identical trees together, in order of increasing size
Work on groups of 32 cells. Last group may have fewer.
Order one level at a time beginning at roots.
  All child1, all child2, ...
